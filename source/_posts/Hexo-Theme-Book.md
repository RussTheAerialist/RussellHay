Over the last day or so, I created a simple [hexojs](http://hexo.io) theme for publishing serial content online, mainly geared towards posting serial fiction or chapters from a novel.

It's called [Book](https://github.com/RussTheAerialist/hexo-theme-book) and is written in Jade + SASS to run under the Hexo static site generator.

It's simple, easy to read, with very minimal navigation. I want it to be as close to an e-book reading experience as possible (though not as configurable)

Take a look at the [Book Demo](http://themes.russellhay.com/book) with content generated from [hipsum.co](http://hipsum.co) and [placekitten.com](http://placekitten.com).
