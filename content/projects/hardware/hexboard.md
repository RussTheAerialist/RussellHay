## 10 May 2016 Update
This project involves lots of leds, some hex dividers, and a picture frame.
I'll control all of this with an arduino and a raspberry pi.

The first step is to create the hex dividers. I first designed and 3d printed
a couple of hexes, but damn 3d printing is slow. It would take me weeks to
create the amount of hexes I need, so decided to learn how to make silicone
molds and cast polyurethane.

The first attempt was a failure, and I don't have a picture.  The silicone
leaked *everywhere*, and the 3d printed part floated to the top, so I decided I needed some clay.  Off the Michael's to get some
sculpey and some hot glue to keep the part down, and that worked amazing.

The first mold came out pretty decent, and made a second one, but between the
first and the second, I did a test casting, and I was pretty happy with it.

Here is a picture of it sitting uncured right after pouring into the mold.

Ten minutes later, and it was demolded. I think I had my ratios slightly off,
when dealing with such small amounts, a 10% variance is pretty easy to overshoot.
The part was soft and somewhat tacky.  After the required 36 hours to full cure,
the part is still a little tacky, but it's hardened up nicely.  It's usable, and
the replication is pretty great.  Below is a picture of the original with the
cast piece.
