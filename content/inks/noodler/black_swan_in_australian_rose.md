![Ink Sample Page for Black Swan in Australian Rose](/inks/black_swan_in_australian_rose.jpg)

This is the first in a series of ink reviews for my fountain pen.  I'm documenting my journey to find the perfect ink to use as my daily use ink.

The **Black Swan in Australian Rose** by Noodler is the first one I'm trying.  I designed and printed out some ink log sheets for my fieldnotes sized [midori](http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/tr/english/)-like notebook.  I wrote out the first couple of stanzas of a [Doom of Exiles](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/doom-of-exiles/) by Sylvia Plath to test out the ink.

Writing with the ink was a pleasent experience.  It's not quite a lubricating ink, so the nib does not really glide across the paper, but it's not scratchy either.  It's a good middle ground.

The ink dries very fast.  As a lefty, this is a vey important trait for an ink.  Not a single smudge with this ink, which is fantastic.

Water-fastness is an important trait for an ink also.  This one is not the ultimate in water-fastness, but it holds up to small amount of water.  There is some initial smearing when I rubbed a wet finger over some test writing, the ink smeared, but the words were still legiable, and additional rubbing did not reduce the legiability further.

The color of **Black Swan in Australian Rose** is quite beautiful. It's a nice combination of a purple with black and red undertones that stand out nicely against a bright white paper.

All in all, this is a solid ink in a beautiful color that has a unique and inticing look.
