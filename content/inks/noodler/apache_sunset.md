![Apache Sunset](/inks/noodler/apache_sunset.jpg)

What can I say about this lovely ink?  I love this ink.  The variation in the color as you write,
even with an extra-fine nib looks lovely on the page.

If I was going to complain about anything is that this is not a fast drying ink by any stretch of
the imagination.  As a lefty, that can pose a problem, but I adjusted to it well enough.  I had
this as my work-a-day ink for an entire month, and it looked fantastic in my notes and my journal.

This is an ink that I loved as a sample, I don't think I'm going to invest in a bottle because of
the slowness of the ink.
