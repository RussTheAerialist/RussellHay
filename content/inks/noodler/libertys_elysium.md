![name of ink](/inks/noodler/libertys_elysium.jpg)

A rather pedestrian ink by Noodler that I found to be too normal for my own tastes.  The ink is a
perfectly workable ink, but the color didn'd suit me. It was too much like a normal blue for me.

One thing that I noticed about this ink is that it smells.  The smell is strong and not pleasant.
I thought it would subside, but it didn't. This made me not keep the ink inside of my pen for
very long.

If you can ignore the smell, this ink would be okay for people with more traditional color
aesthetics.
