![El Lawrence writing sample](/inks/el_lawrence.jpg)

The **El Lawrence** is inspired by the life of T.E. Lawrence, who is more
commonly known as Lawrence of Arabia.  The bottle even has a photo of
him on it.

Overall, I'm a bit underwhelmed by this ink.  The original [color sample](http://www.gouletpens.com/noodlers-el-lawrence-3oz-bottled-fountain-pen-ink/p/N19599) from
[Goulet Pens](http://www.gouletpens.com/) seems to indicate a rich brown with
yellow undertones, but I found the actual ink to be a bit lacking in saturation.

One person to whom I showed my writing sample asked if it was graphite.  It is
very desaturated and translucent on the page, except where I either start or
stop a stroke, and then the richness of the brown comes fourth.

Beyond the color and lack of saturation, it's a fairly well performing ink.
It flowed onto the page smoothly.  In this case, I was using my left-handed nib
in my Lamy pen, which is generally smooth writing experience, but with this ink
in it, it was a small bit smoother.

Noodler is impressing me with how fast their inks dry.  This is a second noodler
ink that dries so quickly that there was no smearing.  Again, this is a super important trait for inks for me, and Noodler is delivering on the fast drying
front.

Because of the lack of richness in the color, I think this will be an ink I will pass on.  If muted, slightly translucent colors are you thing, I think this
would be an excellent ink of journal writing because it's quite pleasent on the page, provides a somewhat muted and lovely presense to the writing.  It even made my chicken scratch look decent.
