Not going to lie, I think this ink is wasted on fine nibs.  The shimmeriness promised is not
realized with the thinness of the lines of my nibs.

The color of this ink is amazing even without the shimmer. It's a quite lovely color and I can't
wait to journal with this ink.  I could see myself loving this ink for a really long time. If
I go, I might spring for a flex nib.

For my first non-Noodler ink in this log, it's a great addition to my sample collection.  If this
ink is any indication, J. Herbin inks dry fast enough for my lefty self.
