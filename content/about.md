![Me](/images/me.jpg)

I'm a southern-transplant living in the greater Seattle area.  I moved
to Seattle on a whim when I was 21, and it was the craziest and best
decision of my life.

I'm a software engineer by trade, and a creative maker by passion.
When I'm not working, I spend a good bit of my time designing
new things, tinkering with electronics, and trying my damnedest
to incite productive mayhem in those around me.

Before a shoulder injury, I spent eight years as a trapeze artist,
putting together a circus to raise money for Seattle Children's.  I was
the technical director, helping organize the technical side of running
a show, and ensuring everything was rigged as needed.

Now, you can find me hanging out at
[Parkour Visions](http://parkourvisions.org), practicing low-line
parkour, and trying to perfect smooth, flowing motion.
