In an effort to better understand aspects of filmmaking that I'm not
familiar with, I'm watching movies and doing an analysis of the film from
different aspects.

This morning, I watched Ghost Ship, which is one of my favorite horror
movies.  It's simple and effective, and while there are some aspects of
the story that are a bit stupid (hello, management and soul quotes, wtf?),
overall, it a really good horror movie.

My focus for this watching was camera movement and music.

## Camera Movement

There are a few distinct visual styles to the movement in this film. During
the opening sequence, when we are shown the original voyage of the ship,
the camera movements are fluid, smooth, and expansive.  You get sweeping
crane shots, tracking and dollying through the movement of the dance floor.

When showing violence, this film uses temporal manipulation, slowing down
and speeding up, adding to the tension of the violence, allowing the audience
to linger on the viscera.

Cut to the modern day, and the camera becomes jerky, with many fast cuts.
These jerky camera movements are intercut with solid, static shots adding
a rhythm to edit of the film.

When the crew are in moments of contemplation, the camera is static, with
little to no camera movement, and what little movement there is usually
is just tracking on the actor in focus or if they are on either of the two
ships, the camera rocks slightly to make the audience feel the rocking of
the boat.  I found that use of camera movement interesting when I first noticed it,
but it blends in and is easily ignored afterwards.

There are two techniques they use to add anxiety to the audience.  They use
both subtle rack focus to defocus the subject, and a very subtle push in
when in close up on one of the actors.

## Music

Ghost Ship was released in 2002.  Music for movies was much different than
it is now. There are two types of music in this film: Orchestral and "standard"
horror.  The two types are used for very different reasons.

Anytime you have standard action movie things happening, like when there
is a fight scene, or sweeping views of any of the ships, or during all of the
lead-in to the real story, you get the Orchestral music.  It's grand and sweeping,
getting swells of sound on important visual moments.

With the Orchestral music, they use J & L cuts all over the place so the music
lingers, or telegraphs something "actiony" is going to happen.

The other type of music they use is pretty standard horror troupe music. High pitched
sounds mixed with low rumbles, sometimes with wave interference sounds mixed in.

They also use the absence of music quite expertly, lingering in silence right
 before or right after something suspenseful happened.
 
The last thing to call out, and this is more about sound than music, is the use
of the radios throughout the exploration of the ship.  The radios are used to
reinforce the sense of isolation, being cut off from everyone else.  The radios
stop working randomly, making communication and connection to other people difficult
or impossible.  This helped to build the atmosphere.
