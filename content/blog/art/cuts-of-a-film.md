As I'm ramping up to direct my first short, one of the things I've been
doing is watching all the videos I can on filmmaking, so I can know
all the parts of the process, including editing, which I may need to
end up doing for this film.

One thing that I'm having a hard time remember is what each type of cut
is.  I hear editors throwing around words like jump cut, smash cut, dip
to black, etc. It's all so confusing for someone who doesn't edit full time.
 
So what better way to remember it than to create a reference for myself.

This post is my reference, and my chance to explain it to you and to myself, and is
primarily based on Rocket Jump's [Transitions and Cuts 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAH0MoAv2CI)
I'm not going to cover transitions because they are more obvious in their names.
I suggest you go watch the video for a full understanding of each of the
different cut types, and how to apply them. It covers things like cutting on the action,
which I won't talk about here.

## All the Cuts You Need to Know

**Cut Away** - Cutting to an insert and then cutting back to the original shot. Like when you
add a reaction shot.

**Cross Cut** - Cutting between two different locations, like with a phone call, or when showing
what's going on inside a character's head.

**Jump Cut** - Cutting to the same shot, usually to show passage of time. Do it in a montage.

**Match Cut** - Cutting from one shot to a similar shot. Like in Grease during
the end of the Grease Lighting dance number. Matching action or composition.
 
**Smash Cut** - Abrupt transitions, like making up from a nightmare, or going
from something intense to quiet or vice versa.

**Invisible Cut** - A Cut hidden in black or in whip pans by hiding the
cut in the motion of the camera, or an object crossing the frame or the
subject leaves the frame.  Basically, anytime you are being clever and
hide the cut.

**L &amp; J Cuts** - Audio cuts where the audio starts before the visual
cut (J) or after the visual cut (L). Creates a seamless flow between shots/scenes.

These are the ones that I hear most often, so now I have a quick cheat sheet
that explains them. Yay.
