It started with a lazy evening of watching youtube videos.  I discovered the [King of Random](KK)'s youtube channel and started watching all of the weekend project videos.

The rocketry episodes were the most interesting and I decided that I want to make one.  I had already ordered a miter chop saw for building parkour obstacles, so this would be a great warm up exercise to try out the saw.

I started looking at a bunch of different designs, and came up with a nice hybrid system that allows me to set any angle, but still be super simple to make.

### Bill of Materials

- 18" of 2" Sch 40 PVC Pipe
- 6" of 1" Sch 40 PVC Pipe
- 12" of ½" Sch 40 PVC Pipe
- 1" Ball Valve (optional? maybe?)
- 2" to 1-½" Bushing (slip on both parts)
- 1-½" to 1" Bushing (innie thread on 1" side)
- 1" to ½" Bushing (outie thread on 1", innie thread on ½")
- x2 2" Elbows
- x2 2" Bushing (slip on both parts)
- x2 1" outie thread adapter
- Bike pump valve (from an old inner tube)

### Needed tools

- Saw (I used a chop saw) for cutting PVC, or just get them precut
- Drill
- KK drill bit
- Teflon tape
- jb weld or plumbers compound
- Goo gone adhesive remover
- spray primer
- spray paint
- painters tape 

### Ignition System

This is listed separately because you can do whatever you want for an ignition system.  This is just what I did.  I built mine so that the ignition system was attached via a headphone cable so that I could change out what triggers the system.  I also wanted to be able to move far enough away from the device when launching, so that's another consideration.

Since I was building the ignition system anyway, I decided to 3d print the pieces.  The STL files are available at [github/RussTheAerialist/parachute](KK).
